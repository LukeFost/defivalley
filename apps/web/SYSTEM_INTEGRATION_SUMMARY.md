# MainScene System Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the new manager systems (CollisionSystem, CameraSystem, and EventBus) into MainScene, removing duplicated code and improving architecture.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added System Imports
- Added imports for CollisionSystem, CameraSystem, and EventBus
- These systems now handle their respective responsibilities separately

### 2. Added System Properties
- Added `collisionSystem` and `cameraSystem` as class properties
- Removed old collision-related properties (collisionGrid, collisionMap)

### 3. System Initialization
- CollisionSystem is initialized with world dimensions and tile size
- CameraSystem is initialized with world bounds and lerp configuration
- Both systems are properly initialized in the `create()` method

### 4. Camera System Integration
- Removed old camera code (`updateCameraFollow`, `setupCameraSystem`)
- Camera now uses `cameraSystem.startFollow()` for following players
- Viewport calculations use `cameraSystem.getViewportBounds()`
- Player visibility checks use `cameraSystem.isPointInViewport()`

### 5. Collision System Integration  
- Removed all old collision methods:
  - `checkTileCollision()`
  - `checkPlayerCollision()` 
  - `checkCliffCollision()`
  - `computeCollisionGrid()`
  - `markBuildingCollisions()`
  - `isPositionSolid()`
  - `checkPlayerCollisionOptimized()`
- Player movement now uses `collisionSystem.checkPlayerCollision()`
- Building collision grid updates use `collisionSystem.computeCollisionGrid()`

### 6. EventBus Integration
- Added event emissions for important game events:
  - `player:joined` when a player joins
  - `player:left` when a player leaves
  - `player:moved` when current player moves
  - `crop:planted` when a crop is planted
  - `crop:harvested` when a crop is harvested
  - `camera:moved` on camera viewport updates
  - `system:shutdown` when scene is destroyed

### 7. Update Loop Integration
- Added `cameraSystem.update()` and `collisionSystem.update()` to the main update loop
- Systems now update independently and handle their own timing

### 8. Debug Tools Enhancement
- Updated camera debug commands to use CameraSystem methods
- Added collision debug visualization commands:
  - `toggleCollisionDebug()` - Visualize collision grid
  - `getCollisionStats()` - Show collision statistics

### 9. Cleanup
- Removed duplicate tile size property
- Removed unused collision map initialization
- Removed old tilemap collision setup code
- Fixed all TypeScript errors

## Benefits
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each system handles its own responsibilities
2. **Reusability**: Systems can be used in other scenes
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to update and debug individual systems
4. **Performance**: Optimized collision detection with spatial indexing
5. **Event-Driven**: Better communication between systems via EventBus
6. **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout

## Usage
The MainScene now has a cleaner architecture with specialized systems handling collision detection, camera management, and event communication. All old duplicated code has been removed and replaced with proper system calls.
